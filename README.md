# Arduino Scripts

Both winter and summer scripts for the arduino.

Summer script turns heating on only when basement goes below required temp and someone home in basement.

Winter script comes on for couple of hours in morning and couple of hours in evening (provided that temp is below required temp).
During the day, the winter script only puts heating on during the day (i.e. working hours) if someone is home in basement.
